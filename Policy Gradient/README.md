# Policy Gradients

#### What is a Policy?
A policy is a set of probability distributions as to what action to take in a given state. Because actions are taken in a probabilistic fashion a rudementary form of exploration is baked into the algorithm.

#### What is the Objective of a Policy Gradient?
To maximise the expected reward. Essentially it tries to make actions which are most likely to deliver high rewards.
